Issues Found in the Code
1. No Input Validation or Error Handling

Problem:
The code assumes all required fields are always present in the request JSON.

Why it’s a problem:

It can crash with a KeyError if a field is missing.

Invalid data types can sneak in (e.g., a string instead of a number for price).

There’s no protection against malformed or malicious requests.

2. Missing Transaction Management

Problem:
There are two separate database commits without wrapping them in a proper transaction.

Why it’s a problem:

If the second commit fails, you end up with orphaned products (products without inventory records).

This creates data inconsistency between Product and Inventory tables.

There’s no rollback mechanism for partial failures.

3. No Duplicate SKU Check

Problem:
The code doesn’t validate SKU uniqueness.

Why it’s a problem:

Database constraint errors can happen if there’s a uniqueness rule.

Duplicate SKUs can mess up inventory tracking.

Business logic breaks because SKUs are meant to uniquely identify products.

4. Missing Proper HTTP Status Codes

Problem:
The API always returns 200 OK, even on creation.

Why it’s a problem:

API clients can’t differentiate between different success types.

This goes against REST best practices (e.g., should return 201 Created for a successful creation).

5. No Authorization or Authentication

Problem:
There are no checks for whether the request is coming from an authorized or authenticated user.

Why it’s a problem:

Anyone can create products in the system.

There’s no audit trail of who created what.

This is a major security vulnerability.

6. Lack of Input Sanitization

Problem:
User input is used directly without sanitization.

Why it’s a problem:

SQLAlchemy helps, but SQL injection risks can still exist if used improperly.

Stored data could lead to XSS attacks if rendered in the frontend.

Data quality issues may arise (e.g., messy strings, invalid formats).
