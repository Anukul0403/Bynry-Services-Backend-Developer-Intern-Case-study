This ERD is built for a system where company can work with their warehouses and products. Each product has a unique SKU and can be stored in several warehouses. The system tracks stock levels and changes over time. Products can be single items or group made up of other products. They can also be connected to various suppliers. Using foreign keys and unique constraints helps maintain data accuracy. The design is good enough to work in future needs such as pricing rules or additional supplier details.
